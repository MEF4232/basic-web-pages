## ✅ Chapter 1 - Introduction

> Think of HTML as the abstract text and images behind a web page, CSS as the page that actually gets displayed, and JavaScript as the behaviors that can manipulate both HTML and CSS. ([Introduction](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/introduction/#html-css-and-javascript))

## ✅ Chapter 2 - Basic Web Pages

## ✅ Chapter 3 - Links And Images

> A website is just a collection of HTML files organized into folders. To refer to those files from inside of another file, the Internet uses “uniform resource locators” (URLs). ([Types Of Links](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/#absolute-relative-and-root-relative-links))

## ✅ Chapter 4 - Hello, CSS

> You can think of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as defining the “design” of a web page. It determines things like font size, margins, and colors using a language entirely separate from HTML. ([Hello, CSS](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/))

> The CSS hierarchy for every web page looks like this:
> * The browser’s default stylesheet
> * User-defined stylesheets
> * External stylesheets (that’s us)
> * Page-specific styles (that’s also us)
> * Inline styles (that could be us, but it never should be)
>
> This is ordered from least to most precedence, which means styles defined in each subsequent step override previous ones. ([The Cascade](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/#the-cascade))
