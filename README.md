# HTML & CSS

## ✅ Chapter 1 - Introduction

> Think of HTML as the abstract text and images behind a web page, CSS as the page that actually gets displayed, and JavaScript as the behaviors that can manipulate both HTML and CSS. ([Introduction](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/introduction/#html-css-and-javascript))

## ✅ Chapter 2 - Basic Web Pages

## ✅ Chapter 3 - Links And Images

> A website is just a collection of HTML files organized into folders. To refer to those files from inside of another file, the Internet uses “uniform resource locators” (URLs). ([Types Of Links](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/#absolute-relative-and-root-relative-links))

## ✅ Chapter 4 - Hello, CSS

> You can think of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as defining the “design” of a web page. It determines things like font size, margins, and colors using a language entirely separate from HTML. ([Hello, CSS](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/))

> The CSS hierarchy for every web page looks like this:
> * The browser’s default stylesheet
> * User-defined stylesheets
> * External stylesheets (that’s us)
> * Page-specific styles (that’s also us)
> * Inline styles (that could be us, but it never should be)
>
> This is ordered from least to most precedence, which means styles defined in each subsequent step override previous ones. ([The Cascade](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/hello-css/#the-cascade))

## ✅ Chapter 5 - The Box Model

> A couple of very important behaviors associated with block and inline boxes:
> * Block boxes always appear below the previous block element. This is the “natural” or “static” flow of an HTML document when it gets rendered by a web browser.
> * The width of block boxes is set automatically based on the width of its parent container. In this case, our blocks are always the width of the browser window.
> * The default height of block boxes is based on the content it contains. When you narrow the browser window, the &lt;h1&gt; gets split over two lines, and its height adjusts accordingly.
> * Inline boxes don’t affect vertical spacing. They’re not for determining layout—they’re for styling stuff inside of a block.
> * The width of inline boxes is based on the content it contains, not the width of the parent element.
> ([Block Vs Inline](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/#block-elements-and-inline-elements))

> The “CSS box model” is a set of rules that determine the dimensions of every element in a web page. It gives each box (both inline and block) four properties:
> * Content – The text, image, or other media content in the element.
> * Padding – The space between the box’s content and its border.
> * Border – The line between the box’s padding and margin.
> * Margin – The space between the box and surrounding boxes.
> ([The Box Model](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/#content-padding-border-and-margin))

> Margins and padding can accomplish the same thing in a lot of situations, making it difficult to determine which one is the “right” choice. The most common reasons why you would pick one over the other are:
> * The padding of a box has a background, while margins are always transparent.
> * Padding is included in the click area of an element, while margins aren’t.
> * Margins collapse vertically, while padding doesn’t.
>
> If none of these help you decide whether to use padding over margin, then don’t fret about it—just pick one. In CSS, there’s often more than one way to solve your problem. ([Margins](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/#margins))

## ✅ Chapter 6 - CSS Selectors

> Pseudo-classes begin with a colon followed by the name of the desired class. The most common link pseudo-classes are as follows:
> * :link – A link the user has never visited.
> * :visited – A link the user has visited before.
> * :hover – A link with the user’s mouse over it.
> * :active – A link that’s being pressed down by a mouse (or finger). ([Basic Link Styles](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-selectors/#pseudo-classes-for-links))

> Parts of a URL https://example.com/selector.html#button-2
> * Scheme: "https://"
> * Domain: "example.com"
> * Path: "/selector.html"
> * Fragment: "#button-2" ([URL Fragments](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-selectors/#id-selectors))

> Where to start building a new web page:
>
> The separation of content from presentation helps guide this process. You need content before you can present it, so your first step is usually to mark up your raw content with HTML tags. Once that’s prepared, you’re ready to add class attributes to your elements and style them one-by-one. When you discover a need for some extra structure to create a desired layout (e.g., turn a group of elements into a sidebar), that’s when you start wrapping your content in container &lt;div&gt;’s.

## ⬜ Chapter 7 - Floats

> “Floats” let you put block-level elements side-by-side instead of on top of each other. Float-based layouts have mostly been replaced with Flexbox in modern websites. ([Floats](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/floats/#setup))
